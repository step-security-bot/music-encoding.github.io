<h2 id="1-preamble">1 Preamble</h2>

<p>The name of this organisation is ‘Music Encoding Initiative’ (hereafter abbreviated ‘MEI’).</p>

<h2 id="2-purpose">2 Purpose</h2>

<p>The purpose of MEI is to create, promote, and diffuse a semantically rich model for music notation that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accommodates the encoding of the intellectual and physical characteristics of music notation documents, primarily focusing on, but not being limited to, Common Western Music Notation (CWMN);</li>
  <li>is designed by the scholarly community for scholarly uses, but does not exclude other uses;</li>
  <li>provides for the common functions of traditional facsimile, critical, and performance editions;</li>
  <li>has a modular structure that permits use dependent on the goals of scholars; and</li>
  <li>is based on open standards and is platform-independent;</li>
  <li>permits the development of comprehensive and permanent international archives of notated music as a basis for editions, analysis, performances, and other forms of research.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-community-membership">3 Community Membership</h2>

<p>Membership in MEI is open to anyone with an interest in supporting the goals and purpose of MEI.</p>

<h3 id="31-types-of-membership">3.1 Types of Membership</h3>

<p>There are two types of membership in MEI: personal and institutional. Both types of members are equally eligible for such membership benefits as the Board may determine from time to time. No member is entitled to a refund of any dues or other charges or assessments upon resignation or termination of membership.</p>

<h4 id="311-personal-membership">3.1.1 Personal Membership</h4>

<p>Only private individuals may obtain personal membership in MEI. Personal membership is conferred by subscription to the MEI mailing list (<a href="https://music-encoding.org/community/community-contacts.html">MEI-L</a>). All personal members may vote, nominate members for office, stand for office, and otherwise benefit from the activities of MEI.</p>

<h4 id="312-institutional-membership">3.1.2 Institutional Membership</h4>

<p>Institutional Membership in MEI is available for any form of organization, project or company. Any of the above wishing to become an Institutional Member of MEI may apply by submitting an application, in a form prescribed by the Board, to any elected member of the Board.</p>

<p>There are three levels of Institutional Membership: An institution that sponsors MEI with an annual contribution of $500, $2000, or $5000 or more will be designated a ‘regular’, ‘patron’, or ‘sustaining’ MEI Institutional Member, respectively. Other forms of in-kind commitment with the same value as the annual fees above, such as staff time or administrative support, may substitute for monetary contributions.</p>

<p>The logos of sponsoring organizations will appear on publications by the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-board.html">MEI Board</a> (e.g. conference proceedings, guidelines) and on <a href="https://www.music-encoding.org">https://www.music-encoding.org</a>. While the logos of sustaining Institutional Members will appear on title pages and on the welcome page of the website, those of patron and regular Institutional Members will appear in a dedicated section.</p>

<p>All Institutional members in good standing have the right to display the MEI logo on any MEI-related publications or products they create or distribute that conform to the license under which MEI is distributed.</p>

<h3 id="32-termination">3.2 Termination</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-board.html">Board</a> may terminate an individual or institutional membership in MEI upon good-faith finding of (a) misconduct by such member reflecting discredit upon MEI or (b) violation of these By-laws.</p>

<h3 id="33-resignation">3.3 Resignation</h3>

<p>Any member may resign from MEI.</p>

<p>Resignation of a Personal Membership is effective upon unsubscribing from MEI-L.</p>

<p>Resignation of an Institutional Membership is effective upon the Board’s receipt of a formal (physical or electronic) notice of resignation.</p>

<h2 id="4-finances">4 Finances</h2>

<p>Financial revenue of MEI  (generated through membership fees, donations, grants, or other means) will be administered by the Board.</p>

<h2 id="5-board">5 Board</h2>

<p>The property and business of MEI are managed by the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-board.html">Board</a>. The broad role of the Board is to promote the development of MEI; oversee the activities of the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/community/technical-team.html">MEI Technical Team</a>; guide the development of the MEI conceptual model, <a href="https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/content/">Guidelines</a>, and schemata; and act as a contact point for MEI-related activities.</p>

The location of conferences will be decided by the Board in a timely manner before the event. The Board will call for conference host applications prior to the decision. Questions regarding the application as conference organizer, program submissions, the choice of the program committee of the conference, etc. should be made as transparent as possible for potential conference organizers.</p>

<h2 id="10-amendments">10 Amendments</h2>

After a minimum 10-day comment period, the Board will discuss comments on the proposed amendments received from the MEI membership and incorporate changes agreed to by a simple majority of the Board.
