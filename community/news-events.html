<h3 class="newsTitle">MEI 5.0 Released<small>2023-09-07 12:00:00 +0000</small></h3>
<div class="newsEntry"><p>The Music Encoding Initiative community and contributors are pleased to announce the release of MEI 5, the latest stable version of the MEI Notation Encoding specification.</p>

<p>This release brings with it the introduction of MEI Basic, a new customization to help drive MEI adoption in mainstream applications. As a smaller subset of MEI, it will help application developers provide support for MEI in their software, while also providing users with a path towards the “full” MEI capabilities should they be needed. With this, we hope to improve application adoption, data sharing between MEI projects, and conversion between MEI and other data formats.</p>

<p>Along with MEI Basic, significant improvements have been made to the guidelines, development infrastructure, and encoding consistency, with only limited compatibility changes to the specifications. This release also brings the availability of an auto-generated PDF version of the guidelines. (see the guidelines and release notes for more details).</p>

<p>To support projects using MEI, we have also updated the Encoding Tools (https://github.com/music-encoding/encoding-tools) and Sample Encodings (https://github.com/music-encoding/sample-encodings) repositories. Notably, an XSLT is available to help projects upgrade their encodings from MEI 4 to MEI 5 (https://github.com/music-encoding/encoding-tools/blob/main/mei40To50/mei40To50.xsl).</p>

<p>The documentation for Version 5 is available on the MEI Website: https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v5/content/index.html</p>

<p>We want to thank the community, and especially the members of the technical team and ODD meetings, for their continued support and engagement! In total, we had over 40 contributors actively involved in the preparation of this release of MEI. Many of them are early-career researchers, investing significant time and effort into the MEI Framework. Since this work often happens alongside conferences, workshops, and other meetings, there is a danger that their contributions are not recognized properly because of relatively informal, but no less significant, settings. We have included in the Guidelines and in the Release Notes a list of our contributors so that we recognize them by name. Without the joint effort of all those involved, an undertaking like MEI would not be possible.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Stefan Münnich
Benjamin W. Bohl</p>

<p>Technical Co-Chairs,
Music Encoding Initiative</p>

<p>PS: If you have not yet heard, our community is also working towards MEI 5 Basic support in <a href="https://musescore.org/en">MuseScore</a>, a popular notation editor! More news on this will follow later this year.</p>

<p><strong>Profesora/Instructor</strong>: Dra. Martha Thomae (McGill University / MEI)</p>

<p>La Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) es un sistema y un lenguaje de marcado para codificar documentos con música en una estructura legible por máquina. Al igual que la Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), la MEI se ha transformado en un estándar de marcado de textos con música en muchos proyectos de Humanidades Digitales y ha venido trabajando en herramientas open source y materiales educativos desarrollados por su propia comunidad. En este taller introductorio te invitamos a que conozcas esta iniciativa y realices un breve ejercicio de codificación de una canción popular. No es necesario tener conocimientos sobre música, sobre la MEI o TEI para sumarse al taller.</p>

<p>Trabajaremos con la plataforma de codificación online MEI friend: https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at/</p>

<h3 class="newsTitle">MEC and TEI 2023<small>2023-02-22 10:09:00 +0000</small></h3>
<div class="newsEntry"><p>The next Music Encoding Conference will be held jointly with the TEI Conference on Monday 4th - Friday 8th September, 2023, at Universität Paderborn in Paderborn, Germany. The Call for Proposals is now open and can be viewed on <a href="https://teimec2023.uni-paderborn.de/cfp.html">this webpage</a>.</p>

<p>The conference theme invites us to think about the need to encode different cultural realms — not only written musical and literary cultures, but also oral cultures, the cultures of underrepresented communities, and even cultural practices beyond language and music, such as dance, theater, and film. In coming together to identify and discuss the commonalities and differences between our two coding communities, we aim to discover new methods and new approaches to encoding culture in all its forms.</p>

<h3 class="newsTitle">Event: Music Encoding Use-cases in U.S. Libraries: Aims, Pedagogy, and Workflows<small>2021-06-27 14:00:00 +0000</small></h3>
<div class="newsEntry"><p>There is a session of interest to the MEI community on Tuesday, July 27 during the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres Congress (IAML) and Digital Libraries for Musicology Conference.</p>

<p><strong>Music Encoding Use-cases in U.S. Libraries: Aims, Pedagogy, and Workflows</strong></p>

<p>July 27, 2021, 19-20.30 UTC</p>

<p>Presented by the Forum of Sections <br />
Chair: Anna E. Kijas <br />
Speakers: Anna E. Kijas (Tufts University), Maristella Feustle (University of North Texas), Jacob Schaub (Vanderbilt University), and David Day (Brigham Young University, Provo, UT)</p>

<p>How are library professionals engaging with music encoding and why? What workflows have been developed to aid in teaching students or staff to transcribe and encode music? By “music encoding” we mean representing music notation in a standardized, machine-readable format. Librarians from four public and private U.S. academic institutions will present music encoding use cases that highlight particular aspects of their collections with a focus on pedagogical approaches, workflows, and choices of technology.</p>

<p>At Tufts University, Lilly Music Library students are working on a music incipits project that aims to make compositions by un(der)-represented composers visible and discoverable. They are developing expertise in transcription and editing, and expanding their knowledge of a diverse music repertoire. Project aims, workflows, and pedagogical value of this work will be discussed.</p>

<p>At Brigham Young University, students are involved in a harp music incipits project that aims to explore how incipits can be used 1) to provide enhanced metadata in online catalogs and/or the planned online harp repertory guide, 2) for analysis of the adaptation of popular songs and operatic arias in harp music arrangements, 3) to create online thematic catalogs for composers who wrote primarily for the harp, and 4)  potentially in RISM. The idea of encoding themes from Pierre Adolphe Capelle’s La clé du claveau will also be explored.</p>

<p>The University of North Texas Music Library is pursuing multiple, complementary benefits through the encoding of early editions of operas and ballets by Jean-Baptise Lully and his sons. Encoding is the first step in unlocking possibilities for discovery, performance, study, and data analysis. A pilot project with one librarian and two graduate students at UNT has focused on encoding the scarcely performed opera Zéphire et Flore by Louis and Jean-Louis Lully, refining workflows and training materials for future plans to encode UNT’s extensive Lully collection.</p>

<p>The Wilson Music Library at Vanderbilt University is exploring areas of MEI pedagogy as well as the potential and challenges of MEI application to contemporary musical manuscripts. In Spring 2020, a student library fellows seminar at Vanderbilt co-led by a music librarian and a musicology faculty member focused on equipping students with the basics of MEI as well as utilizing these tools toward the ongoing encoding of a 1994 working draft of Alfred Schnittke’s Sinfonisches Vorspiel held in Vanderbilt University Special Collections.</p>

<p>These four use-cases will demonstrate the ways in which librarians are engaging with music encoding in ways that highlight aspects of their collections, generate music data for further analysis or research, and create an environment of praxis for students, staff, and faculty.</p>

<h3 class="newsTitle">Proposed changes to MEI By-laws<small>2021-06-24 12:00:00 +0000</small></h3>
<div class="newsEntry"><p>The MEI Board has agreed to propose some changes to the MEI By-laws. Focal changes are the explicit accomodation of any type of music notation, not only Western, in section 2 (“Purpose”), the clarification of Personal and Institutional membership in section 3 (“Membership”), and the explicit integration of appointed offices of the Board and a fine-tuning of the election procedure. Other changes concern minor corrections to wording.</p>

<p>Options to view the proposed changes include:</p>

<p>1) a compiled overview of the changes in a GoogleDoc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHVVA8gkRI-gFDLo4YbtHgslP9K37IbOxX1ctSd_HeA/edit?usp=sharing)</p>

<p>2) a “diff” in the dedicated Pull Request on Github (https://github.com/music-encoding/music-encoding.github.io/pull/234/files)</p>

<p>According to the By-Laws, any proposed amendments must be approved by the MEI community, following this procedure:</p>

<p>“Changes to these by-laws become proposed amendments with a simple majority of the complete Board membership. Proposed amendments will be published on the MEI mailing list (MEI-L) and the MEI website. After a minimum 10-day comment period, the Board will discuss comments on the proposed amendments received from the MEI membership and incorporate changes agreed to by a simple majority of the Board. The agreed upon version of the amended by-laws will be presented to the MEI membership for voting over a minimum 7-day period. The amended version of the by-laws must pass with a two-thirds (2/3) majority of votes in order to become effective.”</p>

<p>The Board invites you to provide any additional comments you have to the GoogleDoc or the Pull Request above.</p>

<p>Any comments before July 5th (23:59:59, UTC-11: https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20210705T105900&amp;p1=3925&amp;p2=137&amp;p3=213&amp;p4=43&amp;p5=136&amp;p6=1976&amp;p7=107&amp;p8=33&amp;p9=248&amp;p10=240) will be considered for final discussion within the Board. The agreed upon version of the amended By-laws will be put to vote over a minimum 7-day period before MEC2021. The voting results will be presented during the Community Meeting at MEC2021.</p>

<p><strong>Teaching Music History Conference 2021</strong></p>

<p><em>Session: Using New Technologies to Enhance Teaching</em></p>

<p>Tuesday, June 15 (4:00 – 5:30 PM)</p>

<p>Session Chair: Timothy Cochran (Eastern Connecticut State University)</p>

<p><strong>4:00 PM (EDT) – The Song’s Opening – Mark Gotham (Universität des Saarlandes &amp; fourscoreandmore.org)</strong></p>

<p>One defining development of the digital age is increased accessibility – more content is available to more people than ever. This session presents new digital resources for increased diversity and accessibility in music teaching, starting with the OpenScore Lieder Corpus, a collection of over 1,000 songs encoded by an academic-community collaboration and released under a licence that enables all use-cases including playback, transposition, and ‘music-minus-one’ directly in the webpage. This collection is powerfully inclusive. First, the additional functionality (beyond print or PDF) makes it easier for anyone who is not an expert score reader to engage with these songs. Re-doubling the significance of that accessibility is the greater diversity of repertoire presented, including many songs that have never been published or recorded. This aids the historical discussion of nineteenth century musical practice, framing the scope in terms of a genre particularly open to all; less dependent on centralised, professional routes such as publication.</p>

<p>Building on this corpus to more specific pedagogical ends are: the ‘Working in Harmony’ app (offering automatic feedback on users’ Roman numeral analyses), and an associated Harmony Anthology I have produced for the Open Music Theory Textbook v2. This new kind of anthology harnesses computational methods to present a much larger collection of examples (deliberately including edge-cases), feature the work of many analysts, and provide links to full scores for all entries. This enables a freer exploration of historical harmonic languages and how they vary from composer to composer and over time.</p>

<p><strong>4:30 PM (EDT) – Encoding Schnittke: A Co-Curricular Experiment in MEI – Joy Calico (Vanderbilt University), Jake Schaub (Anne Potter Wilson Music Library, Vanderbilt University)</strong></p>

<p>In S2020 a music librarian and a musicology faculty member led a co-curricular seminar that taught four undergraduates to encode an Alfred Schnittke MS, recently acquired by their institution’s Special Collections, using the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI). Our intention was to use this seminar as the first step in a long-term project to develop a linked open data resource for research on Schnittke, and provide subsequent cohorts of students with an opportunity to learn music encoding skills while contributing to that project and fulfilling co-curricular research requirements.  This paper (1) describes the process whereby we developed the program using both institutional and external resources; (2) assesses our successes and failures, both pedagogical and programmatic; and (3) shares teaching materials that others could use to teach MEI in different classroom contexts.</p>

<h3 class="newsTitle">Digital Humanities in Early Music Research, 2021/1:  OMR-capable chant editors<small>2021-03-14 12:00:00 +0000</small></h3>
<div class="newsEntry"><p>The Digital Humanities in Early Music Research series of the <a href="http://www.smnf.cz/en/">Old Myths New Facts project</a> (Masaryk Institute and Archives of the Czech Academy of Sciences) presents its first workshop in 2021. The aim of this workshop is to teach participants how to use current software tools capable of optical music recognition (OMR) for processing plainchant manuscripts. Hands-on work is planned!</p>

<p>The workshop will consist of three sessions, two of them led by members of the Music Encoding Initiative Board, Ichiro Fujinaga and Martha E. Thomae (see the following program). <strong>Reservation is required</strong>, so if you wish to participate, please register here: <a href="http://www.smnf.cz/en/news/Digital-Humanities-in-Early-Music-Research-2021-1-OMR-capable-chant-editors/">http://www.smnf.cz/en/news/Digital-Humanities-in-Early-Music-Research-2021-1-OMR-capable-chant-editors/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Session 1 (Talk): Large-scale OMR for neumes with Rodan</strong><br />
(Ichiro Fujinaga, McGill University)</p>

<p><em>March 17th (Wednesday), 4 PM – 5 PM CET</em></p>

<p>The overall goal of the Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) project is to develop a workflow for creating an infrastructure for a musical data discovery system. Here, we describe an online system for large-scale processing of neume music notation called “Rodan.” The system converts the images of music manuscripts to a computer-readable format using optical music recognition (OMR) technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Session 2 (Workshop): Making Rodan work for you</strong><br />
(Martha Thomae, McGill University)</p>

<p><em>March 18th (Thursday), 4 PM – 5:15 PM CET</em></p>

<p>In this second session about SIMSSA (Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis), we will explore in more detail the technologies presented during the first session. We will see each of the OMR-related “jobs” available in “Rodan,” getting to know their settings, and how to interconnect these jobs to generate an MEI file which encodes the contents of a music manuscript. The goal of this workshop is for the audience to learn how to use these technologies for their own purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Session 3 (Workshop): Collaborative digital editions with OMMR4All</strong><br />
(Alexander Hartelt, Würzburg University, accompanied by Jan Hajič, Czech Academy of Sciences)</p>

<p><em>March 19th (Friday), 4 PM – 6 PM CET</em></p>

<p>OMMR4all is a web app for collaboratively creating digital facsimile editions of chant manuscripts in staff notation, with optical music recognition available as a part of the workflow. This workshop session is a hands-on tutorial that aims to teach participants how to efficiently use OMMR4all. We will walk through both manual and automated data entry workflows, show possibilities for collaboration, and demonstrate edition presentation features.</p>

<div class="newsEntry"><p>Dear MEI community,</p>

<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic still not under control, it currently remains uncertain whether travelling in May would be safe enough for everyone. The various vaccines, among other factors, give reason to believe that the situation will improve in later months. Thus, the MEI Board, the Organizing Committee and Program Committee of the Music Encoding Conference 2021 in Alicante have decided to postpone the event by two months. The conference is now scheduled to take place from <strong>Monday 19 to Thursday 22 July 2021</strong> and is additionally being prepared to be held in <strong>hybrid mode</strong> to allow either physical or virtual participation.</p>

<p>The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) is an open-source effort to define a system for encoding musical documents in a machine-readable structure. MEI brings together specialists from various music research communities, including technologists, librarians, historians, and theorists in a common effort to define best practices for representing a broad range of musical documents and structures.</p>

<p>The MEI Board manages the property and business of MEI. It promotes the development of MEI, oversees the activities of the MEI Technical Team, guides the development of the MEI conceptual model, Guidelines and schemata, and acts as a contact point for MEI-related activities. The Board consists of nine elected members and one member designated by each Host Institution. The Board will hold regular, virtual or in-person meetings. As schedules and funding permit, the Board will meet in person at least once per year.</p>

<p>We have a great set of 5 candidates to fill the 3 vacant positions on the MEI Board. You’ll find the candidate statements at: https://music-encoding.org/community/mei-board/elections/2020/candidates</p>

<h3 class="newsTitle">Digital Humanities in Early Music Research I - Session II: Early Music Databases and Encoding<small>2020-05-23 22:45:00 +0000</small></h3>
<div class="newsEntry"><p>A free, open to the public, series of conferences and workshops focusing on the use of digital humanities in early music research will be offered online at the end of June. The Session II of the Digital Humanities in Early Music Research I series will focus on databases and encoding of early music.</p>

<p>Led by two members of the Music Encoding Initiative Board, Elsa de Luca (administrative chair) and Martha E. Thomae, Session II will consist of two presentations and two workshops (see the following program). <strong>Reservation is required</strong>, please contact the coordinator Jana Franková (<a href="mailto:frankova@mua.cas.cz">frankova@mua.cas.cz</a>) and Hana Vlhová-Wörmer (<a href="mailto:vlhova@mua.cas.cz">vlhova@mua.cas.cz</a>) jointly to reserve your place.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation I: MEI for Encoding Mensural Music – A Survey</strong></p>

<p><em>Monday, June 22nd, 16–17h (GMT+2)</em></p>

<p>A peculiarity of mensural notation is the context-dependent nature of the duration of the notes. Mensural pieces are commonly written in separate parts, a layout that does not allow us to visualize the vertical sonorities and appreciate the polyphonic texture of the piece. Although many mensural pieces are encoded in symbolic formats (e.g., MusicXML and MIDI), these files tend to encode the modern transcription of the piece rather than its original (mensural) values. MEI, instead, allows encoding mensural music in the original notation through its Mensural Module. This presentation showcases some projects that have worked on encoding mensural music in MEI. The common goal of these projects is to present the mensural pieces as scores in the original notation. The MEI representation allows visualizing the vertical sonorities (which are hindered by the separate-parts layout of the original sources) while still maintaining the notation of the sources, thus avoiding to lose some important details of the notation in modern transcriptions.</p>

<p><strong>Workshop I: Introduction to MEI</strong></p>

<p><em>Wednesday, June 24th, 16–19h15 (GMT+2)</em></p>

<p>General introduction to MEI (Music Encoding Initiative) and the elements and attributes of the Neumes and Mensural modules.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation II: The Portuguese Early Music Database</strong></p>

<p><em>Monday, June 29th, 16–17h (GMT+2)</em></p>

<p>This presentation introduces a large project on Digital Humanities started about ten years ago by Manuel Pedro Ferreira at the NOVA University of Lisbon. The <a href="http://pemdatabase.eu/">Portuguese Early Music Database</a> is a digital library of Iberian (mainly Portuguese) manuscripts with musical notation written before c. 1650. In PEM, every manuscript is given in full-color reproduction accompanied by a codicological description. Additionally, the musical contents of all fragments—and a selection of codices with monophonic or polyphonic music as well—are fully indexed. Crucially, plainchant in PEM is indexed following the <a href="http://cantusindex.org/">Cantus Index</a> system and, as such, the PEM Database is connected to other international medieval music databases by means of unique Cantus ID numbers. I will discuss the search capabilities of PEM, its contents, and all the challenges related to the development and implementation of such a unique project in early music.</p>

<p><strong>Workshop II: Hands-on MEI Encoding</strong></p>

<p><em>Tuesday, June 30th, 16–19h15 (GMT+2)</em></p>

<p>Presentation of MEI encoding for chant and mensural notations from different areas of Western Europe. Followed by an open discussion of coding examples of the Jistebnický kancionál manuscript.</p>

<h3 class="newsTitle">First Draft of MEI Basic<small>2019-05-31 07:30:00 +0000</small></h3>
<div class="newsEntry"><p>The MEI Community is pleased to announce the first draft version of MEI Basic, 
a simplified profile of MEI intended to support data interchange both
within MEI and with other encoding formats.</p>

<p>MEI Basic has been discussed at several occasions over the past three years.
It intends to simplify MEI so that every feature can only be expressed in one
specific way, and also removes all editorial or analytical possibilities, as
well as the integration of facsimiles and recordings. What is left is a
small core of MEI’s features, that falls in the range of other encoding 
formats and thus allows an easier transformation.</p>

<p>There are still aspects that need discussion, including the question of how
much metadata should be allowed or required by MEI Basic.</p>

<p>The development of MEI Basic happens at a separate branch of the MEI repository 
at <a href="https://github.com/music-encoding/music-encoding/commit/b50748ce537b43e1527791fb41e8c28aa1582cdb" target="\_blank">https://github.com/music-encoding/music-encoding/tree/basic</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone from the MEI Community and beyond is invited to have a look at the 
<a href="/downloads/mei-basic_2019-05-31_184d45b.xml" target="\_blank">current state of the customization</a>,

<h3 class="newsTitle">MEI 4.0 Schema Released<small>2018-11-01 12:00:00 +0000</small></h3>
<div class="newsEntry"><p>The Board of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) is pleased to announce the availability of the MEI 4.0 Schema. The MEI is an international collaborative effort to capture the semantics of music notation documents as machine-readable data. For more information about MEI, please visit https://music-encoding.org.</p>

<p>This release comes after two years of extensive community consultation and development, and we thank all of the contributors in the community who have provided valuable input, feedback, critique, and development.</p>

<p>These conversations have resulted in the most collaborative music notation schema in history. Although there have been many music notation formats, few have achieved broad consultation and feedback, and even fewer have been co-developed in consultation with such a broad spectrum of stakeholders, from industry partners to librarians, publishers to researchers, and computer scientists to digital humanists. It is our sincere hope that we are able to grow and maintain these collaborations into the future.</p>

<p>Although we are releasing the schema today, there is still work to be done. Along with this release, we are seeking help from the community in updating the guidelines, documentation, tools, and tutorials.</p>

<p>The release of the schema represents the beginning of a transition period, where we will be asking contributors to help us write and expand our documentation, and make MEI more broadly accessible to newcomers and specialists. Over the next few months the technical team will be organizing documentation development “sprints” where we hope members of the community will help contribute content updated to the new specification.</p>

<p>The dates for these sprints will be announced on the MEI-L, and members of the technical team will be available on the MEI Slack channel for consultation and discussion during the sprints. It is our goal to present MEI 4.0, both schema and documentation, to the community at the 2019 Music Encoding Conference in Vienna.</p>

<p>For an overview of the changes in MEI 4.0, please see the Release Notes available on GitHub:</p>
