Die Optical Music Recognition-Software soll eine linienlose Notation aus einem der {\"a}ltesten erhaltenen Quellen mit Notationszeichen, dem Antiphonar Hartker aus der Benediktinerabtei St. Gallen (Schweiz), welches heute in zwei B{\"a}nden in der Stiftsbibliothek in St. Gallen aufbewahrt wird, erfassen. Aufgrund der handgeschriebenen, linienlosen Notation stellt dieser Gregorianische Gesang den Forscher vor viele Herausforderungen. Das Werk umfasst {\"u}ber 300 verschiedene Neumenzeichen und ihre Notation, die mit Hilfe der Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) erfasst und beschrieben werden sollen. Der folgende Artikel beschreibt den Prozess der Adaptierung, um die MEI auf die Notation von Neumen ohne Notenlinien anzuwenden. Beschrieben werden Eigenschaften der Neumennotation, um zu verdeutlichen, wo die Herausforderungen dieser Arbeit liegen sowie die Funktionsweise des Classifiers, einer Art digitalen Neumenw{\"o}rterbuchs.}

@inproceedings{Bell_2016,
 abstract = {Conductor copies of musical scores are typically rich in handwritten annotations. Ongoing archival efforts to digitize orchestral conductors' scores have made scanned copies of hundreds of these annotated scores available in digital formats.

The extraction of handwritten annotations from digitized printed documents is a difficult task for computer vision, with most approaches focusing on the extraction of handwritten text. However, conductors' annotation practices provide us with at least two affordances, which make the task more tractable in the musical domain.

First, many conductors opt to mark their scores using colored pencils, which contrast with the black and white print of sheet music. Consequently, we show promising results when using color separation techniques alone to recover handwritten annotations from conductors' scores.

We also compare annotated scores to unannotated copies and use a printed sheet music comparison tool to recover handwritten annotations as additions to the clean copy. We then investigate the use of both of these techniques in a combined method, which improves the results of the color separation technique.

These techniques are demonstrated using a sample of orchestral scores annotated by professional conductors of the New York Philharmonic. Handwritten annotation extraction in musical scores has applications to the systematic investigation of score annotation practices by performers, annotator attribution, and to the interactive presentation of annotated scores, which we briefly discuss.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces Neon.js, a browser-based music notation editor written in JavaScript. The editor can be used to manipulate digitally encoded musical scores in square-note notation. This type of notation presents certain challenges to a music notation editor, since many neumes (groups of pitches) are ligatures–continuous graphical symbols that represent multiple notes. Neon.js will serve as a component within an online optical music recognition framework. The primary purpose of the editor is to provide a readily accessible interface to easily correct errors made in the process of optical music recognition. In this context, we envision an environment that promotes crowdsourcing to further the creation of editable and searchable online symbolic music collections and for generating and editing ground-truth data to train optical music recognition algorithms.},

It reflects Indiana University School of Music's orientation toward Western art music ("classical" music), though it also has a strong jazz program and offers courses in popular music. We believe, however, that our requirements are similar to those of almost any academic music department with a similar emphasis on classical music. Specifically, we believe that most music departments that emphasize classical music will have similar requirements regardless of how they approach teaching music theory and analysis and–at least within the limits of music for performance by instrumentalists and singers–regardless of what styles of composition they emphasize. Beyond that, these requirements directly reflect what information is important in notating music, and they should therefore be of considerable interest to designers of music-editing programs.},

To demonstrate Beethoven's arrangement practices, the original version of each work is synoptically linked with its arrangement in a digital edition called "VideApp Arr". Through digital tools for comparison the relationships between the two versions can be investigated from different perspectives. It becomes visible how the versions are related to each other both by "invariance" (text elements with the same structure), by "variance" (text elements with a similar structure) and, in special cases, also by "difference" (text elements without corresponding parameters). Each view within the "VideApp Arr" is generated from the underlying MEI data.},

We report on the methodology, user-centered development of a suite of tools that we have integrated loosely, in order to experiment with this specific target audience and an evaluation of the impact that such tools may have on how these musicologists carry out their research. Positive feedback relates to the automation of data sharing between the loosely coupled tools and support for an integrated workflow. Participants in this study wanted to have the ability to work not only with individual items, but also with collections of such items. The use of search facets to filter, and visualization around time and place were positively evaluated, as was the use of Optical Music Recognition and computer-supported analysis of music scores. The musicologists were not convinced of the value of activity streams. They also wanted a less strictly linear organization of their workflow and the ability to not only consume items from the repository, but to also push their research results back into the Europeana repository.},

Specifically, the engine combines a system for recognising and responding to musical trigger phrases along with a dynamic digital score renderer. This tool chain allows for the composer's original scoring to include notational elements such as trigger phrases to be automatically extracted to auto-configure the engine for live performance. We reflect holistically on the development process to date and highlight the emerging challenges and opportunities. For example, this includes the potential for further developing the workflow around the scoring process and the ways in which support for musical triggers has shaped the compositional approach.}

The purpose of the DCM was, by nature, broader than that of \textit{The Carl Nielsen Edition, }standing so to speak on two legs: one is the edition of unknown music kept in the library to be used by scholars and musicians and based on a philological approach, the other is the development of ways to disseminate the results of the Centre's work via the internet. The latter aim has resulted in developing a system for storing and presenting data, especially related to thematic catalogs, based on MEI (Music Encoding Initiative) XML. At present, the software developed at the DCM, called MerMEId (Metadata Editor and Repository for MEI Data), is used for catalogs-in-progress for the works of Carl Nielsen, Johan Svendsen, J. P. E. Hartmann, Niels W. Gade, and J. A. Scheibe. In a further perspective, MEI enables the integration of detailed metadata with the full music text, including variants and emendations within the same file in a format that is interchangeable with other software such as a graphical note editor. In our presentation, we will outline the ideas and principles behind the MerMEId software and briefly demonstrate its use, from the point of view of both the editor and the user.},

As an avid lover of both music and computer science, I became intrigued with this void in computer music. What is the proper way to store and symbolize musical scores? Is there a way to encode scores that do not follow standardized rules of notation? Inspired by both the old and new methods of computer music composition and technology, this project seeks to overcome the boundaries between music notation and digital encoding.

An essential component of the work involves devising a semantic infrastructure which allows research data, results and methods to be published in a form that enables others to incorporate the research into their own discourse. This includes ways of capturing the processes of musicology in the form of ‘workflows’; in principle, these allow the processes to be repeated systematically using improved data, or on newly discovered sources as they emerge. A large part of the effort of Transforming Musicology (as with any digital research) is concerned with data preparation, which in the early music case described here means dealing with the outputs of optical music recognition software, which inevitably contain errors. This report describes in outline the process of correction and some of the web-based software which has been designed to make this as easy as possible for the musicologist.},

\textit{Design/methodology/approach} The paper is a general review of existing online indices to music repertoires and some of the general problems associated with selecting metadata and indexing such material and is a survey of the various recent and contemporary projects into the digital encoding of musical notation for online use.

\textit{Findings} The questions addressed during the design of the Bass Culture project database serve to highlight the importance of cooperation between musicologists, information specialists and computer scientists, and the benefits of having researchers with strengths in more than one of these disciplines. The Music Encoding Initiative proves an effective means of providing digital access to the Scottish fiddle tune repertoire.

\textit{Originality/value} The digital encoding of music notation is still comparatively cutting-edge; the Bass Culture project is thus a useful exemplar for interdisciplinary collaboration between musicologists, information specialists and computer scientists, and it addresses issues which are likely to be applicable to future projects of this nature.},

 abstract = {Digital scholarly editions are substantially modifying the way musical editions has been thought and conceptualized over long periods of time. It's hypermedia capabilities, and its multi-layered structure makes it possible to put in context different sources and testimonies in a virtual space where all objects are semantically related, as well as to take into account explicit distinctions about original sources, related historical information, or editorial interventions. Music digital scholarly editions embodied an interactive nature allowing users to choose from different outputs or reading paths on the bias of different purposes; namely musicological study, learning/teaching activities or performing.

In this context, this Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop a theoretical model for the integration of performing variants (technical and/or expressive) that are transmitted orally or through informal channels (marks, notes or text annotations), and usually from teacher to student, within a particular stylistic or interpretive school. The new standards for encoding musical documents like MEI, allow incorporating this information as superposed layers, explicitly differentiated, to the original sources and testimonies. The proposed model is developed within the so-called social editing paradigm, which postulates the integration of some of the 2.0 Web characteristics as the collaborative production of knowledge within the academic editing processes. These new editing practices allow the integration of work's related knowledge, that circulates outside the formal editing and publication circuits, within the scholarly edition.

 abstract = {Common Western music notation is traditionally organized on staves that can be grouped into systems. When multiple systems appear on a page, they are arranged from the top to the bottom of the page, similar to lines of words in a text document. Encoding music notation documents for printing requires this arrangement to be captured. However, in the music notation model proposed by the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), the hierarchy of the XML sub-tree representing the music emphasizes the content rather than the layout. Since systems and pages do not coincide with the musical content, they are encoded in a secondary hierarchy that contains very limited information. In this paper, we present a complementary solution for augmenting the level of detail of the layout of musical documents; that is, the layout information can be encoded in a separate sub-tree with cross-references to other elements holding the musical content. The major advantage of the proposed solution is that it enables multiple layout descriptions, each describing a different visual instantiation of the same musical content.},

 abstract = {Rendering symbolic music notation is a common component of many MIR applications, and many tools are available for this task. There is, however, a need for a tool that can natively render the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) notation encodings that are increasingly used in music research projects. In this paper, we present Verovio, a library and toolkit for rendering MEI. A significant advantage of Verovio is that it implements MEI's structure internally, making it the best suited solution for rendering features that make MEI unique. Verovio is designed as a fast, portable, lightweight tool written in pure standard C++ with no dependencies on third-party frameworks or libraries. It can be used as a command-line rendering tool, as a library, or it can be compiled to JavaScript using the Emscripten LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler. This last option is particularly interesting because it provides a complete in-browser music MEI typesetter. The SVG output from Verovio is organized in such a way that the MEI structure is preserved as much as possible. Since every graphic in SVG is an XML element that is easily addressable, Verovio is particularly well-suited for interactive applications, especially in web browsers.

 abstract = {In the realm of digital musicology, standardizations efforts to date have mostly concentrated on the representation of music. Analyses of music are increasingly being generated or communicated by digital means. We demonstrate that the same arguments for the desirability of standardization in the representation of music apply also to the representation of analyses of music: proper preservation, sharing of data, and facilitation of digital processing. We concentrate here on analyses which can be described as hierarchical and show that this covers a broad range of existing analytical formats. We propose an extension of MEI (Music Encoding Initiative) to allow the encoding of analyses unambiguously associated with and aligned to a representation of the music analysed, making use of existing mechanisms within MEI's parent TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) for the representation of trees and graphs.},

abstract = {We propose a standard representation for hierarchical musical analyses as an extension to the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) representation for music. Analyses of music need to be represented in digital form for the same reasons as music: preservation, sharing of data, data linking, and digital processing. Systems exist for representing sequential information, but many music analyses are hierarchical, whether represented explicitly in trees or graphs or not. Features of MEI allow the representation of an analysis to be directly associated with the elements of the music analyzed. MEI’s basis in TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), allows us to design a scheme which reuses some of the elements of TEI for the representation of trees and graphs. In order to capture both the information specific to a type of music analysis and the underlying form of an analysis as a tree or graph, we propose related “semantic” encodings, which capture the detailed information, and generic “non-semantic” encodings which expose the tree or graph structure. We illustrate this with examples of representations of a range of different kinds of analysis.},

It is a hybrid in that its theatritical apparatus is a digital constellation of auxiliary materials consulted in the course of constructing a new edition, while the score is a conventional one. A user can in principle consult the two bilaterally, but the confinement of the critical report to a physical device unsuited to network use has crippled it in some libraries. Since Prima la musica is both the first of a series of other operas presented in the same way, and of a more opened-ended effort to edit works in other genres similarly, it is important to understand how this combination came to be and what its potential advantages are. Since the new model was perceived by many librarians in the U.S. as excessively expensive, a table of prices of recently published opera editions is provided. These editions prove not to be moderately priced, but the costs of opera scores produced in Europe is, on average, much higher than those produced in the U.S.},

This API was created as a method for addressing and extracting specific portions of music notation published in machine-readable formats on the web. Music notation, like text, can be ``addressed'' in new ways in a digital environment, allowing scholars to identify and name structures of various kinds, thus raising such questions as how can one virtually ``circle'' some music notation? How can a machine interpret this ``circling'' to select and retrieve the relevant music notation?

The API was evaluated by: 1) creating an implementation of the API for documents in the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) format; and by 2) remodelling a dataset ofmusic analysis statements from the Du Chemin: Lost Voices project (Haverford College) by using the API to connect the analytical statements with the portion of notaiton they refer to. Building this corpus has demonstrated that the Music Addressability API is capable of modelling complex analytical statements containing references to music notation.},

 abstract = {This paper presents work on the automatic recognition of measures in common Western music notation scores using optical music recognition techniques. It is important to extract the bounding boxes of measures within a music score to facilitate some methods of multimodal navigation of music catalogues. We present an image processing algorithm that extracts the position of barlines on an input music score in order to deduce the number and position of measures on the page. An open-source implementation of this algorithm is made publicly available. In addition, we have created a ground-truth dataset of 100 images of music scores with manually annotated measures. We conducted several experiments using different combinations of values for two critical parameters to evaluate our measure recognition algorithm. Our algorithm obtained an f-score of 91 percent with the optimal set of parameters. Although our implementation obtained results similar to previous approaches, the scope and size of the evaluation dataset is significantly larger.},

While this provides a comprehensive representation of music content, only concepts and relationships provided by the MEI schema can be encoded. Here, we present our Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD) framework which applies RDF Web Annotations to targetted portions of the MEI structure. Concepts and relationships from the Semantic Web can be included alongside MEI in an expanded musical knowledge graph. We have implemented a music performance scenario which collects, distributes, and displays semantic annotations, enhancing a digital musical score used by performers in a live music jam session.},

@inproceedings{weigl_page_2017b,
 abstract = {Music notation expresses performance instructions in a way commonly understood by musicians, but printed paper parts are limited to encodings of static, a priori knowledge. In this paper we present a platform for multi-way communication between collaborating musicians through the dynamic modification of digital parts: the Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD) framework for distributed real-time annotation of digital music scores. MELD users and software agents create semantic annotations of music concepts and relationships, which are associated with musical structure specified by the Music Encoding Initiative schema (MEI). Annotations are expressed in RDF, allowing alternative music vocabularies (e.g., popular vs. classical music structures) to be applied. The same underlying framework retrieves, distributes, and processes information that addresses semantically distinguishable music elements. Further knowledge is incorporated from external sources through the use of Linked Data. The RDF is also used to match annotation types and contexts to rendering actions which display the annotations upon the digital score. Here, we present a MELD implementation and deployment which augments the digital music scores used by musicians in a group performance, collaboratively changing the sequence within and between pieces in a set list.},

 abstract = {The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) provides a framework for expressing musical notation that enables the identification (via XML identifiers), and thus addressing, of score elements at various levels of granularity (e.g. individual systems, measures, or notes). Verovio, an open-source MEI renderer that produces beautiful SVG renditions of the score, retains the MEI identifiers and element hierarchy in the produced output, enabling dynamic interactivity with score elements through a web browser. We present a demonstrator that combines these capabilities with semantic technologies including RDF, JSON-LD, SPARQL, and the Open Annotation data model, anchoring into the musical notation by using the MEI XML IDs as fragment identifiers to enable the fine-grained incorporation of musical notation within a web of Linked Data. This fusing of music and semantics affords the creation of rich Digital Music Objects supporting contemporary music consumption and performance.},

Digital Humanities For Librarians is a one-stop resource for librarians and LIS students working in this growing new area of academic librarianship. The book begins by introducing digital humanities, addressing key questions such as, "What is it?", "Who does it?", "How do they do it?", "Why do they do it?", and "How can I do it?". This broad overview is followed by a series of practical chapters answering those questions with step-by-step approaches to both the digital and the human elements of digital humanities librarianship.},

@inproceedings{Zitellini_2016,
 abstract = {From the 17th century to the first decades of the 18th century music notation slowly loses all its mensural influences, becoming virtually identical to what we would consider common modern notation. During these five decades of transformation composers did not just suddenly abandon older notation styles, but they used them alongside ones that would eventually become the standard. Void notation, black notation and uncommon tempi were all mixed together. The scholar preparing modern editions of this music is normally forced to normalise all these atypical notations as many software applications do not support them natively. This paper demonstrates the flexibility of the coding scheme proposed by the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), and of Verovio, a visualisation library designed for it. The modular approach of these tools means that particular notation systems can be added easily while maintaining compatibility with other encoded notations.},
